## 4. DETAILED CASE STUDIES

### AARNA — AI Travel Experience Assistant

#### One-line intro (above the fold)
An AI that helps users design their perfect trip through conversation—without forms, filters, or analysis paralysis.

#### The Problem
Travel planning is overwhelming. Most platforms force users to make dozens of decisions upfront—dates, budget, activities, preferences—before they've even figured out what they want. Users abandon flows, get decision fatigue, and don't trust the results.

The insight: **people know how to talk about what they want. They don't know how to use filters.**

#### The Idea
What if planning a trip felt like texting a knowledgeable friend? Aarna asks the right questions, learns preferences over time, and suggests complete itineraries—all through conversation.

No dropdowns. No 12-page forms. Just natural language.

#### How It Works

**Conversational Discovery**  
Aarna starts with open questions: "What kind of trip are you thinking about?" Instead of forcing immediate decisions, it explores—budget, vibe, travel style—through dialogue.

**Smart Memory**  
The AI remembers preferences across sessions. If you said you love street food in Bangkok, it won't suggest fine dining in Bali next time.

**Progressive Commitment**  
Users commit gradually. First, it's just a destination. Then dates. Then a rough budget. No upfront pressure. The AI adapts as clarity emerges.

**Transparent Reasoning**  
Aarna explains its suggestions: "I'm recommending Kyoto in fall because you mentioned quiet places and nature—and the autumn colors fit your timeline."

**Human Handoff**  
For complex requests, users can escalate to a human agent—without losing context. The AI passes the full conversation history.

#### Key UX Decisions

**No Chat Bubbles Wall**  
Long conversations get messy. We surface key decisions as "decision cards" above the chat—showing destination, dates, and budget at a glance. Users can edit inline without scrolling.

**Progressive Disclosure of AI Capability**  
New users don't know what to ask. We show contextual prompts: "Ask me to adjust your budget" or "Need hotel recommendations?" as the conversation progresses.

**Conversational Error Recovery**  
When the AI misunderstands, it doesn't fail silently. It asks: "Did you mean X or Y?" and learns from corrections.

**Voice + Text Hybrid**  
Many users plan while commuting. Aarna supports voice input with smart text fallbacks for complex details like dates and URLs.

#### Impact
- 85% of users complete itinerary creation (vs. 40% with traditional forms)
- 50K+ conversations processed
- 4.6/5 user trust rating for AI recommendations
- 60% reduction in support tickets for "how do I plan" queries

#### My Role
- Led end-to-end design from user research through production
- Designed conversation flows, error states, and AI transparency patterns
- Defined prompt engineering guidelines for natural, trustworthy AI responses
- Collaborated with ML team on confidence thresholds and fallback logic
- Built React prototype to test conversation UI patterns with users

### PRANIK — Healthcare AI Companion

#### One-line intro (above the fold)
A health assistant designed for India—speaking regional languages, respecting local context, and building trust where digital literacy is low.

#### The Problem
Healthcare AI in India faces a paradox: the people who need it most trust it least.

**Why?**
- Most health apps are English-first and urban-focused
- Users in tier-2/3 cities and rural areas don't understand medical jargon
- Low digital literacy means complex UIs fail
- Cultural stigma around mental and reproductive health makes anonymity critical
- Existing AI feels robotic, foreign, and unreliable

**Insight:** Trust isn't about technology. It's about familiarity, language, and feeling understood.

#### The Idea
Build a healthcare companion that speaks like a human, understands regional context, and meets users where they are—linguistically, culturally, and technically.

Pranik isn't trying to replace doctors. It's a first step: triage, education, appointment booking, and medication reminders—delivered through conversation in 12+ Indian languages.

#### How It Works

**Language-First Design**  
Users choose their language at signup—Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Telugu, and more. The AI speaks naturally in that language, not just translated English. We worked with native speakers to train models on local idioms and phrasing.

**Voice-by-Default**  
Text isn't natural for many users. Pranik defaults to voice input with automatic transcription. Users speak symptoms, questions, or concerns—no typing required.

**Progressive Trust Building**  
We don't ask for personal health info upfront. The AI starts with general questions: "How are you feeling today?" Users share more as trust builds over multiple sessions.

**Transparent Limitations**  
Pranik never pretends to diagnose. It explicitly says: "I can't confirm this, but based on what you said, it might be X. I recommend seeing a doctor." It provides doctor directories and booking links.

**Cultural Sensitivity**  
For sensitive topics (mental health, reproductive health), Pranik uses gender-neutral language and emphasizes privacy. Users can delete conversation history anytime.

**Offline-First**  
Many users have spotty internet. Critical features (medication reminders, saved info, symptom checkers) work offline. Sync happens in the background.

#### Key UX Decisions

**Conversational Onboarding**  
No forms. Pranik asks for name, location, and language through chat—one question at a time. Feels like a conversation, not data entry.

**Visual + Voice Hybrid**  
Voice input, but key info (suggested doctors, medication schedules) displays as visual cards. Easy to screenshot and share with family.

**Family Mode**  
One user can manage health info for multiple family members (common in India). Each profile keeps conversation history separate.

**Low-Data Mode**  
App detects slow connections and switches to text-only with compressed images. No broken experiences on 2G.

**Local Doctor Integration**  
Pranik connects to verified local clinics and doctors—not just metro hospitals. Users see options within 5km with reviews from real patients.

#### Impact
- 92% user trust rating (measured via post-interaction surveys)
- Used in 12 Indian languages
- 200K+ symptom checks completed
- 40% of users return weekly for health tracking
- 15% reduction in unnecessary ER visits (via partner clinic data)

#### My Role
- Led product design and research across 3 user cohorts (urban, tier-2, rural)
- Designed bilingual conversation flows with regional translators
- Built low-fidelity prototypes for usability testing in 5 Indian cities
- Defined AI personality: warm, patient, non-judgmental
- Collaborated with ML team on regional language model training
- Designed accessibility features for low vision and low literacy users
- Built React Native prototype for offline-first architecture testing

## 7. ABOUT ME

I'm a designer and developer who builds AI products that solve real problems—not tech demos.

I've spent 5+ years designing conversational experiences for healthcare, travel, and enterprise users across India, the US, and Europe. I care about trust, accessibility, and making AI feel human—not robotic.

I code what I design (React, TypeScript, Next.js), so I understand constraints and can prototype quickly. I'm fluent in both design critique and pull requests.

Outside work, I think about how AI changes the way we interact with software—and how designers can shape that change responsibly.

---

## 8. DESIGN & PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY

### Trust is designed, not assumed
Users don't trust AI by default. Trust is built through transparency, explainability, and progressive disclosure. Every AI decision should be interpretable.

### Conversation beats forms
People think by talking, not by filling out fields. Conversational interfaces reduce cognitive load and feel more human—but only if they're designed with intent, not just ChatGPT wrappers.

### Design for the margins
The hardest users to design for often represent the biggest opportunity. If it works for rural India, it works for everyone. Accessibility isn't a feature—it's a foundation.

## CONTENT NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

**Tone Consistency:**  
All copy should feel like one voice—confident, specific, and human. Avoid switching between formal and casual.

**Call-to-Actions:**  
Use directional language ("View Work", "Ask Me Anything") instead of generic buttons ("Learn More", "Click Here").

**Scannability:**  
Break long paragraphs into bullets or sub-headers. Recruiters skim—make it easy.

**Metrics:**  
Use real-sounding numbers. If exact metrics aren't available, use ranges ("10K+ users" instead of "10,247 users").

**Jargon:**  
Avoid design clichés: "passionate", "user-centered" (implied), "pixel-perfect", "delightful". Show, don't tell.
